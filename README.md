## How to use the simulator?
Simulator uses ROS Navigation and TEB Planner: https://youtu.be/JuZ8gpx9oO4

## What if I don't see a tractor in RVIZ?
When rviz starts it doesn't load the rviz config file.  You will need to go to File and load sim config file.
Sometimes when you press the File tab it just shows black.  You will need to stop rviz and relaunch the sim:
